# Christina's NYC Bucket List

This is a personal bucket list where I can keep track of all the places I want to visit in New York City before my time here is up! I hope that by exploring this project, you also discover some fun places to experience.

## Context
I’ve been meaning to create a bucket list of all the places I want to visit, because I’m the type of person who will save things and then never look at them again, since I know the archive will always be there. (But don't be fooled! These archives are not permanent and you should probably save backups. Anywho...)

This project began as a student assignment to create a website using only HTML and CSS. After completing the initial requirements, I expanded it using Cursor (AI-assisted development) to add dynamic filtering and JSON-based data management, exploring how AI tools can accelerate feature development.

#### If you were curious, the initial assignment requirements were:

##### HTML:
- Must include a page named index.html (as your site’s homepage)
- Should include additional HTML files as necessary to build out your site (for a total of 3 to 5 html files i.e. web pages), e.g. resume.html, all relatively linked through some form of navigational section throughout your site.
- All your html file(s) must be implemented using HTML5 and should be validated in an html5 validator (e.g. https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input )
- Within your’s HTML site, include at a minimum:
    - One table (with any contents)
    - One ordered list (with any contents)
    - One unordered list (with any contents)
    - A third list that is a nested list (with any contents)
    - Links and images*, as appropriate
    - Copyright symbol, your name, and the current year at the end of every page
    - *Images must adhere to copyright law. Use your own multi-media work or freely reusable images (e.g. Creative Commons licensed work, DALL-E images you create, etc.)

##### CSS:
- Your HTML files should link to your external css file in the head of your file (e.g., <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="screen.css">) and all CSS styles should be contained in this one external CSS file that is used across every page in your site.
- Your CSS file must validate according to the http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ validator.
- In your CSS styles, you should at a minimum:
    - Define and use several type selector, e.g. p {…}
    - Define and use several id selector, e.g. #footer {…}
    - Define and use several class selector, e.g. .description {…}
    - Use CSS to generally style your page(s), e.g. to control border, width, color, background-color, font style, font size, layout and positioning, etc.


## Process

My goals were to make this accessible and scalable. Since I wanted to share it with friends, it needed to be mobile-friendly. And since I'd be adding places over time, I needed filtering capabilities without a backend.

### Phase 1: Hand-Coding
I started by designing mockups in Figma and collecting my must-visit places in Apple Notes. Then I built the site with HTML and CSS, learning through:
- Questions to my partner and friends
- Online tutorials and documentation
- Trial and error (so much error!)

What I built from scratch:
- Translated my Figma designs into HTML/CSS
- Set up a modular CSS architecture with root variables for colours, spacing, and typography
- Created reusable card components with consistent styling
- Implemented responsive grid layouts
- Established a type scale and font hierarchy
- Built semantic HTML structure with data attributes for future filtering
- Ensured mobile responsiveness across breakpoints
- Added subtle hover states and micro-interactions

This exploratory phase was incredibly fulfilling. While I didn't solve every challenge alone, finding the right resources to bring my vision to life taught me how the pieces fit together.

### Phase 2: AI Enhancement

Using Cursor, I:
- Migrated static HTML content to JSON data structure for scalability
- Implemented JavaScript filtering by category (food, experiences, etc.)
- Added responsive filter UI with tag-based navigation
- Debugged through iterative screenshot-based feedback

The AI-assisted coding was super efficient, but I'm grateful I hand-coded first; understanding my codebase made me a better AI collaborator. The more specific my requests, the better the results.

## Key Takeaways
This experiment showed me AI tools work exceptionally well for simple projects when you:
- Know what you want visually
- Understand the desired functionality in logical terms
- Can provide clear feedback iteratively

## Next Steps
Besides iteratively editing this website to document my time in NYC, I want to explore more hand-coding and AI-coding technologies to create:

- Mobile app development from scratch
- Projects solving real user problems
- More complex state management
